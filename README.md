### 🔍 Running the Application

1. **Extract the Files (if necessary)**  
   If you downloaded a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file, right-click on it and select "Extract" or "Unzip." This will create a new folder containing all necessary files.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   In the terminal, type the command to move to the folder where you extracted the files. For example:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```
   Replace `path/to/your/folder` with the actual path.

4. **Install Dependencies**  
   To prepare your project, run the following command:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
   Ensure you have `pnpm` installed. If not, refer to the official [pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation).

   Start the local development server with this command:
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```
   This command will run the application on your local machine.

6. **Open Your Browser**  
   After starting the application, open your web browser. Go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your new Astro project in action.
